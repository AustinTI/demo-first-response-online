Introduction
============

First Response Online is a communication and collaboration platform
built to support first responders. It lets police officers, fire
fighters, and paramedics share critical data with each other in near
real-time. It supports iPhone, iPad, and PC and integrates with computer
aided dispatch and GPS tracking. Units in the field can update their
status, complete traffic stops, and even query state & federal databases
all without using the radio.

First Response Online is powered by Azure. In order to build a business
that handles major life-threating incidents, they not only rely on
Azure’s proven scalability and availability but also its breadth of
features to get to market quickly. By using services like App Service,
Azure SQL, DocumentDB & Azure Search, First Response Online can instead
focus on empowering first responders instead of maintaining
infrastructure.
